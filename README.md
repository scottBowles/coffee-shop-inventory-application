Coffee Shop Inventory Application

This was made as a project to learn Express & MongoDB with Mongoose, following completion of MDN's Local Library tutorial.

I used it as an opportunity to learn some Bootstrap, and mixed up my handling of asynchronous code, using the async library (with callbacks, as in the tutorial), promises, and async/await, to gain comfort with all.

There are many ways this could be improved, a few of which I began to list in the pagesDesired file. The code's readability and consistency could also be improved, including but not limited to changing to a consistent handling of asynchronous code. I have chosen to leave some as is, as it served as a useful exercise, but I may go back and clean things up at some point. A number of functions could be factored out to make the code more DRY.
