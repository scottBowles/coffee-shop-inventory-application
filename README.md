Coffee Shop Inventory Application

This was made as a project to learn Express & MongoDB with Mongoose, following MDN's Local Library tutorial.

I used it as an opportunity to learn some Bootstrap, and used the async library (using callbacks, as in the tutorial), promises, and async/await, to gain comfort with all.

The site is live at: https://corcovadocafe.herokuapp.com/

To run locally, assuming you have node/npm & git installed, the following should get you up and running:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:scottBowles/coffee-shop-inventory-application.git
$ cd coffee-shop-inventory-application/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
