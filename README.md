## About

This traditional server-side website was made as a project to learn Express & MongoDB with Mongoose.

I used this as an opportunity to grow in comfort with the various ways of handling asynchronous code -- using callbacks, promises, async/await, and the async library commonly used in legacy code.

Bootstrap

There are many ways this could be improved, a few of which I began to list in the pagesDesired file. The code's readability and consistency could also be improved, including but not limited to changing to a consistent handling of asynchronous code. I have chosen to leave some as is, as it served as a useful exercise, but I may go back and clean things up at some point. A number of functions could be factored out to make the code more DRY.
