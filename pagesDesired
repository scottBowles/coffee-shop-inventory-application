TODO
STILL NEED TO:

FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET DATES TO WORK RIGHT AND NOT OFFSET BY ONE (MDN MENTIONED TIME-ZONE-RELATED)
VALIDATE PARAMS
ORDER DELIVERY DATES -- IS SOMETHING FUNKY GOING ON? MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS
CONSIDER REMOVING RECEIPT DELIVERY DATE -- AT THE MOMENT IT IS IDENTICAL TO RECEIPT DATE
ADD LINK TO RECEIPT PAGE ON ORDER DETAIL PAGE, ONCE ORDER IS RECEIVED
GET IT TO ORDER RECEIPTS THE WAY I WANT ON RECEIPT HOME PAGE. MAY NEED TO ADD LAST UPDATED DATE.
SINCE ADDING A RECEIPT VIRTUAL TO THE ORDER SCHEMA, SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP THE ORDER CONTROLLERS TO USE THIS RATHER THAN FETCHING THE MATCHING RECEIPT ON THEIR OWN
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LANDING PAGE -- ITS VARIOUS LINKS, WHETHER ORDERS SHOW THE APPROPRIATE ONES, ETC.
